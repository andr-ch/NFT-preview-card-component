### What I learned

1. learned to create a unique visual effect by adding two layers of shadows to an element:
```css
.content {
box-shadow: 1px 12px 0px 10px #0c1628, -1px 12px 0px 30px #0c192c;  
}
```

2. discovered how to make paragraphs and images appear on the same line:
```html
<section class="profile-details">
  <p><span class="made-by">Creation of</span> <span class="creator-name">Jules Wyvern</span> <img src="images/image-avatar.png" alt="Placeholder-image"></p>
</section> 
```

3. learned to create an overlay effect on top of an image:
```html
<section class="content-pic">
   <img src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="NFT-pic">
   <div class="image-overlay"></div>
</section>
```

4. how to manage content visibility within .content-pic while containing overflow:
```css
.content-pic {
 overflow: hidden;
}
```

5. ensured the image fills the entire container (.content-pic) while preserving aspect ratio:
```css
.content-pic img {
object-fit: cover; 
}
```

6. applied styles to .image-overlay to cover the entire .content-pic container and initialized it as transparent:
css
```css
.image-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: rgba(87, 255, 249, 0); 
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease; 
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

7. using pseudo element to display icon content for the hover effect:
```css
.image-overlay::before {
    content: url('images/icon-view.svg'); 
    display: none; 
}
```

8. adjusted the overlay to become more opaque and transparent on hover:
```css
.content-pic:hover .image-overlay {
    opacity: 1; 
    background-color: rgba(87, 255, 249, 0.3);
}
```

9. displayed the icon content for the hover effect using display: block:
```css
.content-pic:hover .image-overlay::before {
    display: block; 
}
```

10. made the image partially transparent 
```css
.content-pic:hover img {
    opacity: 0.3;
}
```
